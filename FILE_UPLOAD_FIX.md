# File Upload Fix Summary

## Issue
- Uploaded organization logos were not displaying (showing as null)
- Application form PDFs resulted in 404 errors
- Files were stored without proper extensions

## Root Cause
The multer configuration used `dest: uploadsDir` which stores files with random names without extensions:
- Files like `7b5587e258466cc4f447b031822f8be9` (no extension)
- Browsers couldn't determine MIME type for proper rendering
- URLs like `/uploads/abc123` don't indicate file type

## Solution
1. **Updated multer configuration** to use `diskStorage` with custom filename function
2. **Preserved file extensions** by extracting from `originalname`
3. **Generated unique filenames** with timestamp and random suffix
4. **Added file cleanup** for old files during updates and deletions

## Changes Made

### 1. Multer Configuration (server/routes.ts)
```javascript
// OLD: dest: uploadsDir (no extensions)
const upload = multer({ dest: uploadsDir, ... });

// NEW: diskStorage with extension preservation
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => cb(null, uploadsDir),
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9);
    const extension = path.extname(file.originalname);
    cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + uniqueSuffix + extension);
  }
});
```

### 2. File Cleanup on Update
- Before updating, retrieve existing scholarship
- Clean up old logo/form files when new ones are uploaded
- Only delete files that are in the `/uploads/` directory

### 3. File Cleanup on Delete
- Retrieve scholarship before deletion
- Clean up all associated files (logo and application form)
- Delete scholarship record after file cleanup

## Expected Results
- ✅ Organization logos display correctly as images
- ✅ Application forms open as PDFs without 404 errors
- ✅ File URLs include proper extensions (e.g., `/uploads/logo-123456789.png`)
- ✅ Browsers can determine MIME types correctly
- ✅ Old files are cleaned up to prevent storage bloat

## File Examples
**Before:**
- `/uploads/7b5587e258466cc4f447b031822f8be9` (no extension)

**After:**
- `/uploads/logo-1753454307381-250350832.png`
- `/uploads/applicationForm-1753454307381-557127392.pdf`
